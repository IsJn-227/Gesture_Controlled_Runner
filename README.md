# 🏃‍♀️ Unity Runner Game with Gesture Controls

This project is a modified version of a Unity endless runner game (originally by Ankush1122), now controlled using hand gestures via webcam.

## ✨ What's New
- 🎮 Control your character using hand gestures!
  - ✋ Swipe hand left/right → Change lanes
  - ✋ Raise hand up → Jump
- 🔍 Real-time detection using:
  - `MediaPipe`
  - `OpenCV`
  - `pyautogui` (to simulate keypresses sent to Unity)
